# flappy-bird
My flappy bird clone.
I have challenged myself to not use any of the SFML View classes but still simulate the bird flying through the world past the pipes.
This is done by moving the pipes while the bird is in the same position in world/screen space. (apart from y, but it never goes offscreen)
